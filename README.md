## 🚀 About Me

I'm a passionate web developer focused on building clean, responsive, and user-friendly web applications.  
I enjoy working on real-world projects, college mini/major projects, and smart system applications that combine **Web + IoT**.

From intuitive frontends to functional logic, I love creating solutions that are simple, scalable, and effective.
